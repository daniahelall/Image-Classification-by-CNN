# Image-Classification-by-CNN
Image Classification model to identify different species of flowers using transfer learning techniques.
This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive image classification pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes steps for loading and preparing a dataset, visualizing the data, and building a complex deep learning model that combines three pre-trained networks (EfficientNetB0, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2) for transfer learning. The model is trained on a dataset of flower images, and the performance is evaluated using validation and test datasets.
